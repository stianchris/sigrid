sigrid (PSS sincal importer for grids) contains Python based scripts to import networks from PSS Sincal and convert them to PyPSA and TESPy networks. It was developed during the EU-funded project ES-Flex-Infra by Christian Brosig and is now published as a free package in the hope, that it may be useful to others. Feel free to further develop it!

Documentation
=============

The package consists of the modules xml_import, xml_to_pypsa and xml_to_tespy.
xml_import is the base class and provides basic functionality.
xml_to_pypsa implements filters to acquire the necessary data for pypsa and provides further functionality to test and process the grid.
xml_to_tespy does the same for the tespy environment

Installation
============

There is no integration in PyPSA or TESPy yet. To use this package, just clone it. It depends on the following packages, that are not in the standard library:
- pandas
- networkx
- utm
- pypsa
- tespy
