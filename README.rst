# sigrid
sigrid (PSS sincal importer for grids) contains Python based scripts to import networks from PSS Sincal and convert them to PyPSA and TESPy networks. It was developed during the EU-funded project ES-Flex-Infra by Christian Brosig and is now published as a free package in the hope, that it may be useful to others. Feel free to further develop it!

Documentation
=============

The package consists of the modules xml_import, xml_to_pypsa and xml_to_tespy.
